# User_Access
Below is the technical stack on what I have used:
  1. Python == 3.9
  2. Flask==2.1.2
  3. pymongo==4.1.1
 
 For DB, I have used the No SQL Mongo DB
 
 Below are the artefacts in GIT:
 1. Data_Normalization PPT has the image on how the data has been normalized.
 2. userdb is the DB name that has been created in MongoDB.
 3. Data Table folder in GIT has the base data which has been cleaned and normalized. The data in the csv files are imported as table into Mongo DB which will be the base data for all tables
 
 Running the code:
 
 Once DB and table set up is done, the code can be imported and run in any IDE. I have used PyCharm.
 app.py is the main file
 main.py has the configuration for DB
 
 This can be run from the command prompt too, by the command Python app.py
